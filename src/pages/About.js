        I was born and raised in Nacogdoches, Texas. After graduating from Woden High School,
        I joined the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2003, I served in Operation Iraqi Freedom with 
        Port Security Unit 309. During this deployment, I met my wife, Bethannie. We were married 
        in September 2004 and in 2006, we were blessed with our amazing daughter, Kylie. I have been 
        stationed in Texas, Virginia, California, Alaska, Michigan and Ohio. In 2022, I retired from
        the Coast Guard as a Senior Chief Petty Officer. Upon retirement, I completed the Hack Reactor
        Military Career Skills Program and learned how to become a full-stack (PERN) software engineer.
        My family comes first in my life. My interests include college football, playing golf and being outdoors.
