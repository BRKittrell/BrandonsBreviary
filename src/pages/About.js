        After high school, I joined the U.S. Coast Guard. I served in
        Operation Iraqi Freedom with Port Security Unit 309. During this
        deployment, I met my wife, Bethannie. We were blessed with our amazing daughter, Kylie. 
        After my Coast Guard career, I completed the Hack Reactor Military Career
        Skills Program and learned how to become a full-stack (PERN) software
        engineer.
